Hello! I'm a PhD Candidate at Indiana University's [Center for Complex Networks and Systems (CNetS)](http://cnets.indiana.edu/) working primarily with [Fil Menczer](http://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/) and the [Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)](https://osome.iuni.iu.edu/).

My recent projects are focused on measuring influence on Twitter. In particular, I'm measuring changes in topical attention and expressed topical sentiments after exposure to suspicious content, such as bots, misinformation, and coordinated information campaigns.  I am also working on developing new tools necessary for this task, especially Deep Learning models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to do keyword extraction and targeted sentiment analysis (a.k.a. aspect-based sentiment analysis, or ABSA). 

I am applying some of these measurement tools in the [CoVaxxy project](https://osome.iu.edu/tools/covaxxy) in which we are studying COVID vaccine hesitancy, and the relationships to COVID public health behaviors and outcomes.
