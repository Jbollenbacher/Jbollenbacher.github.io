Hello! I'm a PhD Candidate at Indiana University's [Center for Complex Networks and Systems](http://cnets.indiana.edu/) working with [Fil Menczer](http://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/) and the [NaN group](http://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/). Check out the [cool tools](https://osome.iuni.iu.edu/tools/) our lab has built to analyze social media.

Check out [my CV](https://jbollenbacher.github.io/my_cv/) for more info, and feel free to contact me for collaboration or questions!
