Hello! I'm a PhD student at Indiana University's [Center for Complex Networks and System](http://cnets.indiana.edu/) working with [Fil Menczer](http://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/) and the [NaN group](http://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/). Check out the [cool tools](https://osome.iuni.iu.edu/tools/) our lab has built to analyze social media.

My work focuses on modeling and simulating social systems, and on tracking and analyzing information campaigns and information warfare.
